## Prerequisites

Before you can start using DataTutor, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Python**: DataTutor requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can install Python from the official Python website or using a package manager such as Anaconda.
- **pandas**: Install the pandas library using pip or conda by running `pip install pandas` or `conda install pandas`.
- **scikit-learn**: Install scikit-learn using `pip install scikit-learn` or `conda install scikit-learn`.
- **Other Dependencies**: Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to install additional libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Installation

To install DataTutor on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the DataTutor repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devghori1264/datatutor.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset by placing it in a suitable directory, ensuring it is in a compatible format such as CSV or Excel.

## Configuration

Before running DataTutor, ensure you configure the following settings:

- **Dataset Path**: Specify the path to your dataset in the configuration file (`config.yml` or `config.json`). Ensure the dataset is accessible and properly formatted for preprocessing.
- **Model Parameters**: Adjust model hyperparameters and configuration options in the configuration file to customize the training process according to your requirements.

## Usage

Using DataTutor is straightforward and intuitive. Here's a brief overview of the basic usage workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load your dataset into DataTutor and apply preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables using built-in transformers and pipelines.
2. **Model Training**: Choose a machine learning algorithm and specify the target variable for training. DataTutor will automatically split the dataset into training and validation sets, perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as grid search or random search, and evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Once the training process is complete, DataTutor provides detailed performance metrics and visualizations to help you assess the quality of the trained model and identify areas for improvement.
4. **Model Deployment**: After selecting the best-performing model, deploy it to production or export it for integration into other applications using industry-standard serialization formats such as pickle or ONNX.
